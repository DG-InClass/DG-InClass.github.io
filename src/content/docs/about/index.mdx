<Image src={dg} alt="Dan Gilleland (NAIT)" class="float-end" width="75" /> My name is <span lang="en" aria-label="dan GIL-el-land">**Dan Gilleland**</span>. I began this site in January 2026 as a place to centralize resources for my term-to-term delivery. While the material here is primarily for myself, I do make some items available as supplementary student resources.

Why would I put supplementary student resources here instead of the <a href="https://lms.nait.ca/d2l/home" target="_blank">official <abbr title="Learning Management System">LMS</abbr></a>? Because this is *much* easier to maintain. My efforts to create content here won't be held back by the clunkiness inherent in many <abbr title="Learning Management System">LMS</abbr> platforms today.

## Using this site

Use the side-bar site navigation if you know where you want to go. If you are unsure of where to find what you're looking for, then use the built-in search (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>). It's pretty good, and is part of the [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) framework this site is built on. Alternatively, check out the first item in each of the following areas:

{/* <CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Your First Tutorial" href="/tutorials/0012/" />
  <LinkCard title="How-To Guides" href="/guides/0010/" />
  <LinkCard title="Explanations" href="/explanations/0010/" />
  <LinkCard title="References" href="/reference/0000/" />
</CardGrid> */}

<Aside title="Where is it?">
  This site is undergoing active changes. If I (Dan) just directed you here for a quick update, and you can't see the content, try refreshing your browser. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> to do that.

## Audience & Content Advisory

For my students this semester, you can find my <a target="_blank" href="https://dgilleland.github.io/schedule">teaching schedule</a> online (blank parts of my schedule are taken up with prep, meetings, etc.). I also use an **Instructor Workbook** for each section to track what we've covered and what's upcoming.


## Student Workbook and Integrations 💯

If you're one of my students, then you know that I *daily* reference Student Workbooks. I also strongly encourage my students to add homework and other practice materials to their workbook.

Here are general steps you can follow if you desire to use the samples here.

<Steps>
1. First, pick out some tutorial you want to add to your workbook (for example, [Querying the DOM](/tutorials/0030)).
1. Choose a place in your workbook. For example, create a `query-dom` folder under the `src` folder.

   <FileTree>
   - docs/
   - src/
     - ...
     - query-dom/ Sample subfolder for your specific tutorial
     - ...
   - ReadMe.md
   </FileTree>

1. Follow the tutorial by creating the file(s) and adding the provided assets.
</Steps>

If you are looking for my template repository for my various student workbooks, they are pinned on <a href="https://github.com/dgilleland" target="_blank">my GitHub profile</a>.

<Aside title="In-Class Instructions">
  I might offer guidance on *where* to place them for in-person lessons or as practice/homework assignments.
