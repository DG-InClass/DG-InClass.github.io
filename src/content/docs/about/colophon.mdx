## Custom components

I've created a couple of custom components that I use in various parts of my site.

### `Tiged.astro`

I am often calling on my students to grab starter kits from my *Instructor Repository* and put them into their *Student Workbook*. To do that, I have them use the <a href="https://github.com/tiged/tiged" target="_blank">`tiged`</a> command in the VS Code terminal.

For students new to programming, I have found this approach a lot faster and simpler than trying to guide them on how to handle zip files and put them in the right place. More importantly, I don't have to mess around with *creating* or *maintaining* those zip files! I just have to put some starter code in my instructor repo!

import tigedCode from '../../../components/astro/Tiged.astro?raw';

<Code code={tigedCode} lang="astro" title="Tiged.astro" />

### `When.astro`

In Jan 2026, I've been teaching few new courses, and I've been given lesson plans to follow in class. But sometimes the plan doesn't match reality.

The `<When />` component allows me to make a quick note about when the particular lesson was planned to be delivered and when it was actually delivered.

import whenCode from '../../../components/astro/When.astro?raw';

<Code code={whenCode} lang="astro" title="When.astro" />
