## Advanced UI Communication with Custom Events

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Explain the role of custom events in enabling advanced UI communication.
- Demonstrate how to create, dispatch, and handle custom events in JavaScript.
- Apply custom events to decouple component logic and improve maintainability.

> Emphasize how custom events enable loosely coupled communication, reducing reliance on direct parent-child props or global state.
>
> Highlight trade-offs: great for decoupling, but overuse can make event flow harder to trace.
This lesson bridges vanilla event concepts with framework-based communication strategies introduced later.
