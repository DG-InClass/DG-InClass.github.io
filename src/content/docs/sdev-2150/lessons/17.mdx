## Static Routing with React Router 7

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Configure React Router 7 with `createBrowserRouter` and `RouterProvider`.
- Define static routes and navigate between them using the `Link` component.
- Implement a layout route with `Outlet` to maintain consistent UI structure across pages.

Additional Notes:
Encourage students to keep routes simple (no params yet) and confirm understanding before adding dynamic paths.
React Router 7's Data APIs (loaders, actions) will be introduced in later lessons when working with API-driven routes.
