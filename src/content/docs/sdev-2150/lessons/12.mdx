## Event Handling and State in React

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Implement event handling for user interactions in React components.
- Use the `useState` hook to manage and update component state.
- Build interactive UI components that respond to user input.

Additional Notes:
Emphasize that React events are synthetic and cross-browser compatible.
Keep examples focused on `useState`; context-based state will come later.
Encourage using DaisyUI components (e.g., buttons, inputs) to demonstrate styling within event-driven UIs.
In React 19, the new Actions API (`useActionState`) can streamline form event handlingâ€”mention as an emerging feature but keep focus on `useState` for now.
