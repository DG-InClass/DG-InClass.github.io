### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Apply Tailwind CSS utilities to style React components for consistent and scalable UI design.
- Organize and manage component-level styling for clarity and maintainability.
- Implement responsive design principles using Tailwind's breakpoints and variants.

Additional Notes:
Encourage use of semantic HTML and accessible color contrasts when styling.
Remind students to use Tailwind's documentation as an active design reference.
Tailwind 4 introduces CSS-based configuration with `@theme`; continue using Tailwind 3 conventions in this course.
DaisyUI will be introduced later as an optional extension for component prototyping.
