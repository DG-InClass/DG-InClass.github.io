### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Explain the principles of server-side rendering and how it differs from client rendering.
- Describe the benefits and trade-offs of SSR in terms of performance, SEO, and complexity.
- Explore how frameworks such as React Router v7 and Next.js implement SSR and hybrid rendering.

Additional Notes:
Emphasize that students are not expected to implement full SSR yet (focus on understanding its purpose and process).
Time permitting, compare with Next.js as a reference framework to show SSR, static generation, and hybrid options conceptually.
React 19 introduces enhancements for streaming and progressive hydrationâ€”mention as a future direction.
Prepare to transition from rendering strategies to state management patterns in the next lesson.
