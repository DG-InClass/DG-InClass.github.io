### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Differentiate between local and global state in React applications.
- Implement shared state using React's Context API.
- Identify when to use client-side global state versus server-synchronized data.

Additional Notes:
Emphasize that Context API solves data-sharing issues but is not ideal for frequently updated or asynchronous data.
Demonstrate how multiple contexts can be composed for different domains (e.g., AuthContext, ThemeContext).
React 19 introduces improved context batching and transition handlingâ€”mention as future enhancement.
Prepare students for Lesson 24, where they'll integrate server-side state management using TanStack Query.
