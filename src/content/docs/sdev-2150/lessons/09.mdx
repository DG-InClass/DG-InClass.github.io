## Component Composition in React

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Explain the principles of component composition in React.
- Differentiate between presentational and container components.
- Build complex UIs by composing multiple smaller components together.

Additional Notes:
Stress that composition is React's preferred paradigm over inheritance.
Use simple but meaningful examples (dashboards, lists, cards) to show practical reuse.
Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and Render Props are legacy patterns but worth a brief mention as alternatives to composition.
