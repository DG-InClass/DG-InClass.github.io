### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Explain how component state drives UI updates in React.
- Implement conditional rendering and dynamic list rendering.
- Compute and display derived state for responsive user feedback.

Additional Notes:
Emphasize using stable keys when rendering lists to avoid performance or reconciliation issues.
Demonstrate how React avoids direct DOM manipulation by re-rendering declaratively.
React 19's improved rendering pipeline enhances async rendering - mention as a preview but stay with React 18 behaviour.
Reinforce that clear data flow and predictable state lead to reliable UI updates.
