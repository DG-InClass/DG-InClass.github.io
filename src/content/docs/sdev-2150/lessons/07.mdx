## Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Scaffold a React project using Vite and verify the local development workflow.
- Configure Tailwind CSS with Vite and apply utility-first styles to a simple component.
- Create and compose basic React components using JSX and props.

> Keep scope tight: no state, no routing. Focus on scaffold + JSX + props + basic composition.
>
> If time allows, mention React DevTools installation for future debugging (no demo today).
>
> Reuse SDEV1150 ESLint setup; ensure react/react-hooks plugins are added to eslint.config.mjs.
>
> Save any DaisyUI usage for a later styling-focused lesson once Tailwind basics are solid.
