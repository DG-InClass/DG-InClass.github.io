### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Install and configure DaisyUI in a React + Tailwind project.
- Use DaisyUI prebuilt components to accelerate UI development.
- Customize themes and integrate DaisyUI components into existing layouts.

Additional Notes:
Demonstrate DaisyUI installation
Encourage students to review DaisyUI's theme customization options (`daisyui.themes` in the config).
Tailwind 4 introduces CSS-based `@plugin` imports - when upgrading, DaisyUI setup may simplify further.
Remind students that DaisyUI is layered atop Tailwind - utility knowledge remains foundational.
