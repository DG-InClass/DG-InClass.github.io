## Building Components in React

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Build structured React components using props, children, and internal state.
- Demonstrate component composition patterns for modular UI design.
- Apply Tailwind utilities to style React components consistently and maintainably.

Additional Notes:
Keep `useState` usage simple (booleans, strings, counters). Avoid complex state until later lessons.
Encourage composition mindset: build small, focused components, then combine them.
In React 19, new hooks like `useActionState` simplify async UI state updates; not required here but worth mentioning as "what`s next."
Tailwind 4 introduces `@theme` for CSS-based config; continue using Tailwind 3 utilities in this course.
