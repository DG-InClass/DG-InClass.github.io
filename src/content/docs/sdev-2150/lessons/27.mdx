## Unit Testing React Applications

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Set up and configure Vitest and React Testing Library for React projects.
- Write unit tests for components to validate behaviour and rendered output.
- Interpret test results and debug failed test cases effectively.

Additional Notes:
Emphasize that unit tests verify *behaviour* rather than implementation details.
