## Client Rendering Strategies in React

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Explain how client-side rendering works in React applications.
- Describe the role of the virtual DOM and reconciliation in the rendering process.
- Evaluate the strengths and limitations of client rendering compared to server rendering.


Additional Notes:
Emphasize the declarative nature of React's rendering model and how it differs from manual DOM manipulation.
Demonstrate the difference between initial mount and re-render visually using React DevTools.
React 19 introduces improved concurrent rendering for smoother UI updates mention as a preview of future rendering improvements.
Prepare to contrast these concepts with server-side rendering in Lesson 22.
