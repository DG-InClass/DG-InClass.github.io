### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Explain the JavaScript event loop and differentiate between synchronous and asynchronous operations.
- Demonstrate how to use Promises and async/await to manage asynchronous tasks.
- Apply error-handling strategies to ensure reliable execution of asynchronous code.

> Reinforce the visual model of the event loop to support conceptual understanding.
>
> Encourage students to experiment with debugging asynchronous code to reveal timing behaviour.
