## Test-Driven Development in React

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Explain the principles and workflow of Test-Driven Development (TDD).
- Write tests that define expected behaviour before implementing functionality.
- Apply the red-green-refactor cycle to build reliable and maintainable React components.


Additional Notes:
Emphasize that TDD encourages writing only as much code as needed to pass a test.
Encourage students to think in terms of behaviour rather than implementation.
Stress that tests act as living documentation of behaviour.
