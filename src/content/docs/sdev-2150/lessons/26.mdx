- Apply TanStack Query to manage server-side state across multiple components.
- Demonstrate query invalidation and optimistic updates through coding challenges.

Additional Notes:
Scaffold a simple API endpoint or mock server if desired.
Encourage students to experiment with query keys and observe caching patterns in Devtools.
Offer optional stretch goals for advanced learners, such as paginated queries or dependent queries.
