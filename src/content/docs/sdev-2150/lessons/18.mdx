### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Define and configure dynamic routes using URL parameters.
- Use the `useParams()` hook to retrieve and display data based on route parameters.
- Implement nested routes for organizing related content within larger views.

Additional Notes:
Reinforce that route parameters are strings - convert to numbers when needed.
React Router 7's Data APIs (loaders/actions) can load data directly via routesâ€”this will be covered in data-fetching lessons.
