## Lifting State and Component Communication

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Explain the concept of lifting state up and when to apply it in React applications.
- Pass state and event handlers between parent and child components using props.
- Identify the challenges of prop drilling and discuss patterns for managing shared state effectively.

Additional Notes:
Emphasize the "single source of truth" principle in React state management.
Encourage visualizing data flow diagrams before coding to clarify component relationships.
Avoid introducing Context API yet - save it for global or complex state lessons (Week 8+).
In React 19, `use` and server-driven state patterns simplify lifting in async data scenarios - mention as a preview only.
