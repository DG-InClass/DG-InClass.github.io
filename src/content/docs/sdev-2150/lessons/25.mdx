## State Management Strategies

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Use TanStack Query's invalidation and refetching mechanisms to synchronize client state with the server.
- Implement optimistic updates for smoother user experiences.
- Extend TanStack Query usage with advanced caching scenarios and error recovery workflows.

Additional Notes:
Encourage students to explore the TanStack Query Devtools to observe invalidation and refetch behaviour.
React 19's concurrent features improve async rendering and may further enhance server-state synchronization performance.
