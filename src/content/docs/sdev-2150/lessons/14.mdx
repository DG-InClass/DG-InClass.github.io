### Learning Outcome Guide

- Review and demonstrate mastery of component state and communication techniques from the previous two lessons.

Additional Notes:
Prepare 3-4 exercises increasing in complexity (e.g., 1: simple counter; 2: lifted form; 3: interactive list with shared parent state).
Encourage students to work independently but allow brief peer collaboration for troubleshooting.
Remind students that global state management will be introduced laterâ€”focus on prop-based communication for now.
