## Component Lifecycle in React

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Explain the React component lifecycle and how it applies to functional components.
- Use the `useEffect` hook to handle side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, and cleanup.
- Manage dependency arrays to control when effects run and prevent unnecessary updates.

Additional Notes:
Emphasize how `useEffect` replaces class lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`).
Demonstrate how missing dependencies can lead to stale data or infinite loops.
Mention React's strict mode intentionally double-invokes effects in development for debugging - this is normal.
React 19 introduces improvements to `useEffect` timing and async rendering consistency - note as a preview only.
