## Data Fetching Strategies in React

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Implement asynchronous data fetching using `fetch()` and `useEffect`.
- Manage loading and error states during data retrieval.
- Compare client-side data fetching with route-based data loading in React Router 7.

Additional Notes:
Reinforce that `useEffect`'s dependency array must be used carefully to prevent infinite requests.
React Router 7's Data APIs (`loader`, `action`, `useLoaderData`) automate data fetching per routeâ€”this will be explored in a future lesson.
Optional extension: mention how TanStack Query can further simplify asynchronous state management (to be covered later in the course).
