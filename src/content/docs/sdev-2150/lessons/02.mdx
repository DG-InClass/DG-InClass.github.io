## Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Review key features of Web Components, including custom elements, shadow DOM, and templates.
- Extend reusable Web Components by applying composition techniques.
- Evaluate the benefits of composition over inheritance for modular UI design.

> Keep the review brief; focus more on **applying and extending concepts** rather than reteaching basics.
>
> Highlight how **composition practices** will carry forward into framework-based development in Week 4.

## Web Components

From the prior term, the following LOGs existed for Web Components:

- Define the core principles of web components and their benefits in front-end development.
- Create a simple custom web component using the Web Components API.
- Utilize the shadow DOM to encapsulate styles and DOM structure within components.
- Implement HTML templates and slots to build reusable and dynamic components.
- Apply styles within a web component using the shadow DOM.
- Explain the differences between global styles, shadow DOM styles, and component encapsulation.
- Use CSS custom properties (--variables) to allow external customization of web components.
- Implement dynamic styling using JavaScript inside a component.
- Explain how data may be passed into or read from a web component using attributes and properties.
- Emit custom events from a web component for listening.
- Expose methods and properties for external JavaScript control.
- Store and update simple internal component state and synchronize it with properties/attributes.
- Store and update internal state within a web component.
- Use getters and setters to interact with component properties dynamically.
- React to state changes and update the UI accordingly.
- Explain key lifecycle callbacks (connectedCallback, disconnectedCallback, attributeChangedCallback) and use them for initialization and cleanup.
- Explain the role of unit testing in front-end development and why testing web components is important.
- Set up a basic test environment using a JavaScript testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
- Write unit tests to verify the rendering and functionality of custom web components.
- Use mocking techniques to test components in isolation.
- Execute and interpret test results to debug and improve components.
