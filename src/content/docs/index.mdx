## <CharityWater /> About This Site (&copy; 2026 - Dan Gilleland)

I've created this site as a set of supplemental resources for my students.

<CardGrid stagger>
	  <Card title="Under Construction" icon="information">
        Expect this site to be sparse but growing as the term progresses. With the new diploma and all fresh course material, the shape/content of this site is sure to be changing. (I just don't know how at the moment....)
	  </Card>
    <Card title="Sporatically Updated" icon="add-document">
        This is <b>NOT</b> a substitute for your student workbook or attending Dan's classes. Rather, it's a supplement that Dan will add random things to.

    <Card title="Dana Marsh's Notes" icon="approve-check-circle">
        My colleague **Dana Marsh** has an ***excellent*** <a target="_blank" href="https://dmarshnait.github.io/cpsc1520/QuickReference">summary of the current CPSC-1520 content</a> which is definitely worth a read as a quick reference!
