## Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Define what is meant by a "Terminal Command" and a "CLI"
- Distinguish between a built-in terminal command and a CLI
    - A terminal command typically refers to a command/program that is native to the shell and/or the operating system
    - A CLI typically refers to an additional program that you can install on your computer and use from the terminal
    - CLIs are more likely to have an "interactive" element, whereas native terminal commands will not be "interactive"
- Demonstrate the ability to pass arguments and flag to a command or CLI
- Interpret the terminal window to determine your current path
- Display a directory listing of the files/folders in your current path
- Navigate to a different path within the terminal
- Create folders under your current directory
