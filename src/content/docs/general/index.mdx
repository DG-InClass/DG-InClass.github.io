There are a lot of skills/compentencies that you will need to develop while you are taking regular courses for your software diploma. Often, your instructor mentions these as passing comments, perhaps with a few links to where you can learn more. And then, they "fall into the background". They don't disappear &mdash; rather, they are used in the background by your instructor. You might notice, you might not. But these are the things that - if you learn them - will help you stand out among your peers.

I'm including a few short pages that offer a *condensed* reference on these skills. If you practice them daily (like **you will have to do** in your job), they will serve you well throughout your career.

## Using Command Line Tools

In the early days of computing, all you had were terminal commands. Since the 1990s, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) became the norm - not only for regular users, but for developers as well. Then, in the late 2000s and more prominently in the late 2010s, the terminal environment became the go-to place for any *serious* software developer.

Get started with the terminal environment by [discovering the terminal](), [playing with CLIs](), and daily practicing things like [git]() and [node/npm/pnpm]().

## Writing Documentation

Documentation happens - or at least it *should*. You can make your documentation tasks easier and more enjoyable if you take the time to learn **Markdown**.

## Version Control *Everywhere*
