This January 2026 is the first time I am teaching the *SDEV-1150* course. While I'm familiar with JavaScript, I'm still discovering how the material is organized/prioritized in this course.

In each of the upcoming lessons, I will include the posted [Learning Outcome Guides]() (*LOGs*). In this first delivery, I might also lean on the <a href="https://github.com/DG-InClass/SDEV-1150-A04-Jan-2026/blob/main/Agenda.md" target="_blank">agenda on my **Instructor Workbook**</a>. In the past, I used agendas like these as a reference for what we will be covering in class and as a simplified way of grabbing the starter kits to use in your student workbook.

## Student Textbook

This course uses a [textbook](#javascript-from-beginner-to-professional) which is available free online to NAIT students.
