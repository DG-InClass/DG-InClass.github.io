This January 2026 is the first time I am teaching the *SDEV-1150* course. While I'm familiar with JavaScript, I'm still discovering how the material is organized/prioritized in this course.

In each of the upcoming lessons, I will include the posted [Learning Outcome Guides]() (*LOGs*). In this first delivery, I might also lean on the <a href="https://github.com/DG-InClass/SDEV-1150-A04-Jan-2026/blob/main/Agenda.md" target="_blank">agenda on my **Instructor Workbook**</a>. In the past, I used agendas like these as a reference for what we will be covering in class and as a simplified way of grabbing the starter kits to use in your student workbook.

## Student Textbook

This course uses a [textbook](#javascript-from-beginner-to-professional) which is available free online to NAIT students.

<Steps>
1. Visit the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/member/login/" target="_blank">O'Reilly website</a>.
1. Choose the "Affiliated with a school or institution" option.

## JavaScript QuickStarts


You can explore JavaScript without any other web files (HTML/CSS) or even a web server! This is possible by using **NodeJS**.

To run a single JavaScript file in your student workbook using Node, do the following:


1. Open a new terminal in VS Code.
2. Change to this directory: `cd src/js-quickstart`
3. Run your script in watch mode. For example, if you have a file named `sandbox.js`, you can run it by entering `node --watch sandbox.js`.
4. Now, you can position your terminal and your JavaScript file side-by side and watch what happens as you edit and save your code!


### Debugging

import toolbar from './img/toolbar.png';
import debugTerminal from './img/debug-javascript-in-terminal.png';
import breakpoint from './img/breakpoint-gutter.png';

<Image src={toolbar} alt='toolbar.png' />

You can also open a JavaScript Debug Terminal and use breakpoints along with VS Code's built-in debugging tools. It's the same steps as above, but you begin with selecting **`JavaScript Debug Terminal`** from the terminal's drop-down.

<Image src={debugTerminal} alt='debug-javascript-in-terminal.png' />

To put a breakpoint on a line of code, simply click on the left of any line number of your code (this area is called the gutter) to toggle breakpoints on and off.
