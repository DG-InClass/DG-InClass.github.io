### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Explain how REST-style APIs support front-end applications and data-driven UI.
- Set up and run JSON Server to simulate a REST API from a local JSON file.
- Perform GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE requests using a REST client and the browser, and interpret responses. (Recommend REST Client VS Code extension)


Additional Notes:
Focus on front-end consumption of APIs. Avoid deep backend topics; JSON Server stands in as the API.
Encourage students to inspect Network tab and verify request/response cycles.
