## HTML Form Validation

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Implement built-in HTML form validation attributes (required, min, max, pattern, type).
- Create custom form validation using JavaScript event handling.
- Provide dynamic feedback to users about input validation status.


Additional Notes:
Prefer small, reusable validation functions when the same checks are needed on `input` and `submit`.
Use `setCustomValidity()` to provide friendly error messages and `reportValidity()` to show them immediately.
The built-in `form.checkValidity()` is useful to gate submit behavior, but custom checks are often needed for rules beyond HTML attributes.
Encourage students to test different invalid inputs and observe the validation messages in the browser.
