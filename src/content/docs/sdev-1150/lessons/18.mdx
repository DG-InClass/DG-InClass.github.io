- Utilize debugging tools in the browser, including console, network panel, and breakpoints for async code.
- Apply error handling techniques to manage failed promises and API requests gracefully.
- Analyze logs and network requests to diagnose and resolve async issues.


Additional Notes:
Emphasize using examples with fetch + JSON Server to replicate real-world API debugging scenarios.
