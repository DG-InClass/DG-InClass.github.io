<Aside title="Self-Check from Readings">
  The course materials contain several "checklists" which direct you to the [textbook](/sdev-1150/#student-textbook) for the course. Here's a few self-check questions from chapter 1.

  > 1. What is the HTML syntax to add an external JavaScript file?
  > 1. Can you run JavaScript in a file with a JS extension in your browser?
  > 1. How do you write a multiple-line comment in JavaScript?
  > 1. What is the best way to remove a line of code from running that you might want to keep as you debug?

  Can you answer these?

## Intro to JavaScript: Types, Variables, Built-in Functions

### Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Identify and differentiate between JavaScript data types (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects).
- Declare and initialize variables using var, let, and const appropriately.
- Utilize basic built-in functions and methods (e.g., `console.log()`, `alert()`, `parseInt()`, `toString()`).
- Demonstrate basic operations on variables, including concatenation and arithmetic operations.
- Write simple scripts to manipulate and display data using variables and built-in functions.

<Aside title="About the Demos...">
Many of the demo starter kits were initially set up by running `npm create vite@latest`. That *scaffolds* (sets up) a project that is not quite "bare-bones".

For a more minimalist setup, you can start with a truely empty web project and then manually add `vite` as the dev/web server and bundler.

<Steps>
1. Run these commands:

    ```ps title="Bare-Bones Setup"
    npm init -y
    npm install vite@latest
    ```

1. Edit `package.json`
1. Create an `index.html`
1. Run the web server `npm dev`
</Steps>

## Coding Demo

To run the coding demo, you need to have your Student Workbook open in Visual Studio Code.

<Steps>
1. Open the terminal window and paste in the following.

    ```ps title="Run from the root of your repository"
    pnpm dlx tiged --disable-cache --force DG-InClass/SDEV-1150-A04-Jan-2026/sk/lesson-03 ./src/lesson-03
    ```

1. Walk through the steps in the `ReadMe.md` of the new lesson.
