> The focus of this lesson is on basic implementation of control structures and using the debugger. If students are concerned that they are learning several control structures in one lesson when weeks are taken to cover these topics in another course, remind them that we will be using these structures every day moving forward, and they will get the exposur they need to fully understand them.
