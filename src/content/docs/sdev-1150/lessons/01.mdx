## Learning Outcome Guide

*At the end of this class, you should be able to...*

- Describe the role of a front-end developer within the software development lifecycle.
- Identify key technologies and tools used in front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Explain the course structure, learning outcomes, and assessment methods.
- Navigate and set up the development environment, including code editors and browser developer tools.

## Coding Demo

To run the coding demo, you need to have accepted your Student Workbook and cloned it onto your computer.

<Steps>
1. Open your Student Workbook in VS Code.
1. Open the terminal window.
1. Paste in the following.

    ```ps title="Run from the root of your repository"
    pnpm dlx tiged --disable-cache --force DG-InClass/SDEV-1150-A04-Jan-2026/sk/lesson-01 ./src/lesson-01
    ```

1. View the code in the files `index.html`, `main.js`, and `styles.css`
1. Open Windows Explorer.
1. Double-click the `index.html` to open it in your browser.
1. Open the dev tools. Notice the error in loading the JavaScript file.
1. Make some code edits.

    ```css title="css/styles.css"
    h1 {
        color: rebeccapurple;
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
    ```


    ```diff lang="js" title="js/main.js"
      console.log('Lesson 01 starter loaded');
    + alert('Hello World-Wide-Web');
    ```

1. Discuss why the CSS was loaded, but the JavaScript was not.
1. Convert this to a Web *Project* by adding the following file: `package.json`

    ```json title="package.json"
    {
      "name": "lesson-01",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "Web Server",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite"
      },
      "keywords": [],
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC",
      "packageManager": "pnpm@10.17.1",
      "devDependencies": {
        "vite": "^7.3.1"
      }
    }
    ```

1. Run `pnpm install` to install (grab) the Vite dependency.
1. Run `pnpm dev` to run the web server. Press `o` and `enter` to open the page in the browser.
1. Observe that the JavaScript now loads and runs.
</Steps>

To finish up, commit and push your code. In the terminal, run the following:

```ps title="Commit and Push"
git add .
git commit -m "My first code demo"
git push
```
