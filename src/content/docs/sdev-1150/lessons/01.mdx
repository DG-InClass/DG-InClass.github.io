## Coding Demo

<InClass term="Jan 2026" done={true} plan='in-class' />

To run the coding demo, you need to have accepted your Student Workbook and cloned it onto your computer.

<Steps>
1. Open your Student Workbook in VS Code.
1. Open the terminal window.
1. Paste in the following.

    ```ps title="Run from the root of your repository"
    pnpm dlx tiged --disable-cache --force DG-InClass/SDEV-1150-A04-Jan-2026/sk/lesson-01 ./src/lesson-01
    ```

1. View the code in the files `index.html`, `main.js`, and `styles.css`
1. Open Windows Explorer.
1. Double-click the `index.html` to open it in your browser.

   Notice how the URL in the browser's address bar notes that this is a *File* as opposed to a standard URL.
1. Open the dev tools. Notice the error in loading the JavaScript file.
1. Make some code edits.

    ```css title="css/styles.css"
    h1 {
        color: rebeccapurple;
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
    ```


    ```diff lang="js" title="js/main.js"
      console.log('Lesson 01 starter loaded');
    + alert('Hello World-Wide-Web');
    ```

1. Discuss why the CSS was loaded, but the JavaScript was not.

   What would happen if we edited the `index.html` reference for the script file, changing it from a *root-relative* link format to a *relative* link?
1. Convert this to a Web *Project*.

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Terminal Setup">
        Run the following from the terminal. Make sure you are in the root of `lesson-01` folder.

        ```ps title="./src/lesson-01 of your workbook"
        pnpm init
        pnpm add -D vite
        code package.json
        ```

        Then, edit line 7 of the `package.json` to read as follows:

        ```json title="package.json"
            "dev": "vite"
        ```
        
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Manual Setup">
        Create a file named `package.json` and paste in the following code. Then run `pnpm install` in the terminal.

        ```json title="package.json"
        {
          "name": "lesson-01",
          "version": "1.0.0",
          "description": "Web Server",
          "main": "index.js",
          "scripts": {
            "dev": "vite"
          },
          "keywords": [],
          "author": "",
          "license": "ISC",
          "packageManager": "pnpm@10.17.1",
          "devDependencies": {
            "vite": "^7.3.1"
          }
        }
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>


1. Run `pnpm dev` to run the web server. Press `o` and `enter` to open the page in the browser.
1. Observe that the JavaScript now loads and runs.
</Steps>

To finish up, commit and push your code. In the terminal, run the following:

```ps title="Commit and Push"
git add .
git commit -m "My first code demo"
git push
```
